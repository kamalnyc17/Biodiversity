# Belly Button Biodiversity
#### This project will create an interactive dashboard to explore the "Belly Button Biodiversity" dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## The Dashboard will contain following components
### 1. Dropdown Menu to select the Test Subject ID
### 2. Demography Table to display relevant information of the selected Test Subject
### 3. Horizontal Bar Chart to display the top 10 OTUs found in the Test Subject.
### 4. Gauge Chart to display the weekly washing frequency of the Test Subject.
### 5. Bubble Chart to display each sample of the Test Subject.

## All the above visualizations will update any time a new Test Subject is selected.
